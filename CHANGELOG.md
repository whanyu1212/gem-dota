## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `gem.teamfight_at_tick(match, tick)` — O(log N) binary-search lookup returning the `Teamfight` whose window contains a given tick, or `None`. Lets agents locate fight context from any combat log event tick.
- `gem.heroes_near(match, tick, x, y, radius)` — spatial query returning all `ParsedPlayer` objects within `radius` world units of a map coordinate at a given tick, sorted by distance. Uses `position_at_tick` internally.
- `gem.ability_level_at_tick(player, ability, tick)` — returns the level (1–4) of an ability at any tick using per-minute snapshot data. Returns 0 if the ability was not yet learned.
- `Teamfight.radiant_kills`, `Teamfight.dire_kills`, `Teamfight.winner` — fight outcome fields. `winner` is `"radiant"`, `"dire"`, `"draw"`, or `"unknown"`. Populated automatically from `slot_to_team` in `match_builder`.
- `group_ability_hits` now used in the HTML match report fight combat log — AoE spells (Ravage, Black Hole, RP, etc.) are collapsed into a single grouped cast row showing all targets and total damage, instead of one row per target.
- Sample report gallery page added to docs (`docs/reports/`) with a live TI14 Grand Finals G1 (XG vs Falcons) report hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Fixed
- HTML match report file size reduced from ~459 MB to ~58 MB. The 9 MB map image was being base64-encoded 22 times (once per teamfight minimap SVG + ward canvas + laning minimap). It is now emitted once as `window._GEM_MAP_SRC` and patched into SVG elements on `DOMContentLoaded`. Repeated hero icon PNGs are similarly hoisted into JS globals.
- Plotly Movement tab frame count reduced by subsampling position log to one frame per 150 ticks (~5 seconds). Previously one frame per raw tick sample caused ~50k Plotly traces and ~180 MB of embedded figure JSON.
- Plotly Movement tab map image resized to 1024px before embedding (down from 8878×8356 source).
- Ward map heatmap overlay was rendered upside-down — grid row 0 (world `YMIN`, south) was drawn at the top of the canvas. Fixed by flipping the row index when reading the heatmap grid.


## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Per-minute combat running totals on `PlayerStateSnapshot` and `PlayerTimeSeries`: `total_hero_damage`, `total_hero_healing`, `total_deaths`, `total_stuns` — accumulated from the combat log as monotonically increasing counters and exposed as `*_t_min` lists on `ParsedPlayer`. Ready for ML feature extraction (diff any window for per-minute rates).
- Combat time-series charts added to the match report HTML (Combat tab) — 2×2 grid showing per-minute hero damage, healing, deaths, and stun duration per player.
- `gem.find_player(match, hero)` — look up a player by hero name without iterating `match.players`. Accepts display names (`"Axe"`, `"Anti-Mage"`), NPC names (`"npc_dota_hero_axe"`), or bare suffixes.
- `gem.constants.hero_npc_name(name)` — reverse lookup from display name to `npc_dota_hero_*` NPC name. Normalises hyphens, underscores, and casing. All 127 heroes in the bundled data are resolvable.
- `ParsedMatch.duration_seconds` and `ParsedMatch.duration_minutes` — convenience properties derived from `game_start_tick` and `game_end_tick`.
- `examples/quickstart.py` — executable version of the quickstart guide, verified against a real replay.

### Fixed
- `docs/guides/01_quickstart.md`, `docs/guides/04_match_data.md`, and `README.md` had numerous references to nonexistent fields (`player.net_worth`, `player.last_hits`, `player.hero_damage`, `player.gold_per_min`, `player.item_builds`, `match.radiant_score`, `ward.placed_by`, etc.) — all corrected to the real API.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Batch processing API — `gem.parse_many()`, `gem.parse_many_to_dataframe()`, `gem.parse_many_to_parquet()` for parallel multi-replay parsing using `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
- CLI `batch` subcommand — `python -m gem batch replays/ --format parquet --output ./out`; legacy bare-path invocation (`python -m gem match.dem`) preserved.
- Docs home page redesigned — hero section with feature cards; Material theme navigation improvements (breadcrumbs, TOC follow, tooltips, social footer links).
- CLI reference guide and batch API reference page added to docs.
- Annotated JSON output guide — real TI14 G1 (XG vs Falcons) replay output explained field by field.
- `examples/ti14_sample.json` — real JSON output from TI14 Grand Finals G1 used as docs reference.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- JSON export API — `gem.to_json()`, `gem.to_dict()`, `gem.parse_to_json()`.
- Parquet export API — `gem.to_parquet()`, `gem.parse_to_parquet()` (requires `pyarrow` or `fastparquet`).
- Rich CLI overhaul — live progress bar (`--progress`), timing summary table (`--timings`), pixel-art banner in a `HEAVY` box, Radiant/Dire colour-coded summary table.
- Docs architecture page redesigned — single pipeline diagram, layer badge rows, output model table; custom stylesheet added.
- Diamond icon added to MkDocs nav bar and favicon.
- Laning guide and Lane Classifier reference added to docs nav (were previously orphaned pages).
- Export formats (JSON, Parquet) documented across home page, quickstart guide, and API reference index.

### Fixed
- `mypy` error in `__main__.py` — `_task_ids` typed as `dict[str, TaskID]` (was `dict[str, object]`), fixing `Progress.update()` argument type error.
- `mypy` error in `dataframes.py` — tormentor loop variable renamed from `t` to `tm` to avoid type collision with the towers loop.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Buyback table in HTML report now shows gold spent per buyback using the exact formula `floor(200 + net_worth / 13)`.
- Extended test coverage for teamfight internals (`_update_centroid`, `_nearest_pos`, `_nearest_xp`, `_near_fight`, HEAL attribution, self-heal exclusion, gold/XP delta, item use).
- Extended test coverage for `_dedup_purchase_log` edge cases.
- Known limitations documented in README: healing lotus pickups (not in `.dem` combat log), reliable vs unreliable gold distinction.
- Releases section in README with per-version high-level summaries.

### Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md` and all repo URLs corrected from `whanyu1212/gem` to `whanyu1212/gem-dota`.
- README screenshots updated and resized to uniform dimensions.

### Removed
- `ParsedMatch.lotus_pickups` — healing lotus pickups are not recorded in the `.dem` combat log under any event type across all tested patches. This field always returned an empty list and has been removed from the public API.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Laning extraction and decomposition via `gem.extractors.lane`.
- Lane-related outputs in parsed match models and dataframe export.
- Damage-type breakdown in combat aggregation outputs.
- Extended ability metadata and parsing support for Aghanim's Scepter/Shard interactions.

### Changed
- Teamfight detection uses temporal windowing only (spatial split behavior removed).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Initial public release of `gem-dota`.
- Core Source 2 replay parser pipeline (stream/reader/sendtables/field decoding/entities/string tables/parser).
- Game events and combat log normalization (Source 1 + Source 2 paths).
- Extractors for players, objectives, wards, courier, draft, and teamfights.
- Match assembly and dataframe export APIs.
- CLI and example scripts, including HTML match report.
- Validation, fuzzing, and parser robustness foundations.
